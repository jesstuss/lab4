    <h1> Welcome to Earth </h1>
    <br>
    <p>Earth is our home, the third planet from the Sun, 
    and the fifth largest in the solar system. It is also 
    the only planet that harbors life (that we know of). 
    It is a terrestrial planet with a diverse eco-system 
    made up of oceans, rainforests, canyons, deserts, 
    mountains, and much more.</p>
